# End-to-End-Datascience
This repository contains the implementation of a full end-to-end Data Science project as part of a learning exercise or internship task. The project encompasses the entire data science lifecycle, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model development and deployment.

Project Goal:

The primary goal is to develop and deploy a complete data science solution, demonstrating the ability to handle each stage of a typical data science workflow.

Instructions:

Develop a full Data Science project
    * Data Collection
    * Preprocessing
    * Model Development
    * Model Deployment
Utilize either:
    * Flask
    * FastAPI
Deliverable: A deployed API or web application showcasing the model's functionality.

Contents:

This repository will likely contain the following components, though the specific structure may vary based on the chosen project:

data: This directory might contain raw data files or scripts used for data collection.
notebooks/:This directory may hold Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model development.
src/:This directory will likely contain the main Python code for the project, including:
    * data_processing/:Scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
    * model/:Code for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
    * app/:Files related to the deployment of the model using Flask or FastAPI (e.g., API endpoints, web application code).
* requirements.txt:A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the project.
* README.md:This file (the one you are currently reading) providing an overview of the project, instructions for setup and execution, and details about the implementation.
Getting Started:

To run this project, follow these general steps (specific instructions might be in the `README.md` within the respective directories):

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bas
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd [repository_name]
   ```

2 .Set up the environment:
    It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment.
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
     venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
     ```
   * Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Follow the instructions within the specific directories (e.g., `data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/app/`) to:
   * Collect or download the data.
   * Preprocess the data.
   * Train the machine learning model.
   * Run the Flask or FastAPI application.

4. Access the deployed API or web application** as instructed in the deployment documentation.

Deliverable:

The main deliverable for this project is a functional API (built with Flask or FastAPI) or a web application that demonstrates the capabilities of the trained machine learning model. Instructions on how to interact with the deployed application will be provided.

Further Information:

For more detailed information about the specific project, the chosen dataset, the implemented model, and the deployment process, please refer to the documentation within the respective files and directories of this repository.
